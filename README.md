# SFML Game Simple 2D Game

## Intro
This is game based on the source code provided by the book **SFML 
SFML Game Development By Example (ISBN 9781785287343)** (https://www.packtpub.com/product/sfml-game-development-by-example/9781785287343).

This repository is a fork from **sschellhoff** (https://github.com/sschellhoff/SFMLGameDevelopmentByExample) who provided the original book's source code in a runnable version.

NOTE: The project is still under develpment!!

## Instructions
### Linux
```
git clone https://github.com/mataktelis11/SFMLGameDevelopmentByExample.git
cd SFMLGameDevelopmentByExample/chapter_07/
./build.sh 
```
This will generate an executable file called **main** in the current dir.
### Windows
coming soon....

## Details
This is game is an improvement of the book's **Chapter 7**. More specifically the following additions have been made:
- Added a healthbar for the player.
- Added a new spritesheet for the player.
- Added music and sounds (not with the book's sound manager but with a much less sofisticated implementation)
- Added a new tileset (16 * 16)
- Minor other changes

This project started because I wanted to create a video game from scratch. Thankfully the book does a good job providing and explaining a templete that can be a good start as my very first game. I strongly recommend you check out this book if you want to see what game development really is.

I chose Chapter 7 as I feel it is a good middle ground for everyone how have read the book. Do not expect this to be the most amazing game ever.

Before checking out the source code I strongly recommend to read the book first (especially if you are relatively new to C++ like me).
